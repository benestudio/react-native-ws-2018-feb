The README for this package is hosted at https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app.

## Development

`yarn && yarn start` will start a watcher that will build artifacts and place them in the build directory.

*Warning*: if you change the template project's dependencies, make sure to update `checkAppName` in `create-react-native-app/src/index.js`.
